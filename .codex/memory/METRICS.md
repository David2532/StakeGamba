Exact aggregate tool/file counts were not exposed after context compaction and are not estimated. Observed inefficiencies: two browser-install command attempts triggered repeated CDN failures; a redundant early math verify/test pair was started before the final gate cycle; root-relative agent document paths caused failed lookups; one targeted ESLint invocation omitted the repository's legacy-config environment; local HTTPS push lacked credentials. Corrections: use only `blacksite:math:test`, route future runs through compact memory, fix agent paths, invoke the package lint gate, stop unchanged browser retries after the documented failure, and use the connected GitHub API for an authorized non-force fast-forward when local credentials are absent.

Observed failures: three expected red `svelte-check` baselines (183 → 29 → 1), one local Playwright install command whose five built-in CDN attempts timed out, one credential-blocked HTTPS push, and one corrected connector response-shape parse. The first remote SHA exposed two workflows for one commit; narrowing the PR base produced exactly one workflow for the final SHA. No subagents or token estimates were used. The pnpm-major mismatch caused broad lockfile churn once; it was removed before commit and the repository-declared pnpm 10.5.0 frozen install passed.
